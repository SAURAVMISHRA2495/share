Title : RISC-V and HPC
Platform : Linux OS Development for RISC-V
Vector (RVV)
Duration : 1 Month
Description : The project explores how the RISC-V ISA could influence the future of High Performance Coumputing. We deduce
into the RVV (RISC-V Vector) extension, development of cross compiler toolchain, setting up emulator, testing
vectorization algorithms, crafting cross-compilation toolchain, integrating seamlessly with emulator, and compiling
detailed documentation for insights dissemination.

Title : ANTI COLLISION
Platform : Embedded C/C++ Duration : 6 Months
Description : The Anti-Collision device is a detection device meant to be incorporated into cars for safety purpose. The device is
intended to to find a way to implement a minimum spacing for cars in traffic in a affordable way. It would also
achieve safety for the passengers from a moving car.

Title : GSM BASED ENERGY METER CONTROLLER
Platform : Embedded C/C++ Duration : 1 Month
Description : It is the system designed to control the loss beard by electricity board technically and non-technically. It can also
inform them about stealing of electricity in exact location within a minute. It can also monitor the overload. It
upload data to server which can be easily monitor by the authority. Using this system consumer can also pay
electricity bill online & monitor energy consumption per day per month etc.
